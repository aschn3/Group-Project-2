Group Project #2

*Project Proposal*
  Recommended Format
  • What is it? What is the app's primary purpose? Why should the app exist?
  • List features users might like about your app (i.e. creating lists, finding people w/ similar interests)
  • Describe a typical user. What reason(s) would they have to use your team's app instead of something else?
  • How might your app work? Sketch or draw an architecture describing the functionality (i.e. client server
  highlighting, mandatory apis, sdks, cloud, etc.). While you most certainly can provide a wireframe, the goal
  is to outline functionality FIRST, then worry about the user interface after Instructional Team approval.
